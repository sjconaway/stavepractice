Welcome to Jack's Stave Practice project!

# Stave Practice #


This is a project on an application for music starters to train the reflection in reading staves.


Learning to read staves rapidly is always a bitter task, especially for adults who have only one or two hours per day learning music, most of which can hardly see any hope in playing instruments according to the staves smoothly.


With this application, users can practice anywhere with a smartphone, in the form of an interesting game, in which users touch the correct piano keys to the notes appearing on the stave, and scores will be rated to reveal the progress of training.
Have fun!
